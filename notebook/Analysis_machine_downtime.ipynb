Your company operates three different machines on its shop floor that produce different sized components, so minimizing the downtime of these machines is vital for meeting production deadlines.\n","\n","Your team wants to use a data-driven approach to predicting machine downtime, so proactive maintenance can be planned rather than being reactive to machine failure. To support this, your company has been collecting operational data for over a year and whether each machine was down at those times.\n","\n","In this first level, you're going to explore and describe the data. This level is aimed towards beginners. If you want to challenge yourself a bit more, check out level two!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2f5929b9-9d9a-457a-99ab-be05f27176f9","metadata":{},"source":["## 💾 The data\n","\n","The company
