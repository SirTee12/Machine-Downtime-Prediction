    "## Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "In this first level of data exploration, I will analyze and describe key aspects of the dataset, focusing on uncovering insights from my perspective. This level is designed for beginners, but I aim to provide a structured and thoughtful approach to answering the given questions. Specifically, I will explore the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ What is the first and last date readings were taken on?\n",
    "+ What is the average torque?\n",
    "+ Which assembly line has the highest readings of machine downtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this process, I will apply fundamental data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights and set the foundation for deeper exploration in subsequent levels."
